# Module 2: Stocks Analysis

## Project Overview
The project aims to help Steve analyze the performance of multiple green energy stocks to determine the best investment options to recommend to his parents. To perform this analysis, we used the flexible VBA code to run for multiple stocks simultaneously to collect certain stock information in the years 2017 and 2018. My main focus was to refactor the original VBA script to improve its efficiency and explain my findings.

## Results
The tables below contain the total daily volume and the annual rate of return for each of the given 12 green energy stocks:

+ **The daily stock volume** is the total number of shares traded within a day and measures how actively stock is traded.  Generally, you want to look for stocks that have high volume. 
+ **The annual rate of return** indicates how much the investment grew or shrunk over one year. Overall in 2017, green energy stocks had a positive yearly return ratio. In 2018 the situation changed significantly, and the majority performed with negative returns. All except one green-energy stock (RUN) indicate risky investments.
